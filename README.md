<h2>Project Description</h2>
....

<h2>Motivation</h2>
in post2video i have open ai key which is share by all users. currently i am working on the free tier and i want to allow each user on the free tier to have up to 6 video upload to youtube and consume no more than 20 cents (later there will be payed tier so things will be more complex) - so how to do it ?

minimally you need the following :

- collect video uploads and api consumption per user
- once limit reach notify and do not allow to enter specific pages

questions
<ol>
<li>can i come with generic design</li>
<li>does design involve ui </li>
<li>does it involve the user management (check <a href='https://github.com/NathanKr/post2video-user-management'>post2video-user-management</a>) i.e. clerk</li>
<li>if clerk is part of the design ---> can i use role for better design</li>

</ol>

gemini answers :
In summary:

<ol>
    <li>Start with a generic design for the core logic of tracking, enforcing, notifying, and blocking</li>
    <li>The initial design doesn't need to include UI details, but you should consider how the UI will eventually interact with the backend</li>
    <li>Your design must integrate with your user management system (Clerk) to associate usage with specific users</li>
    <li>Leveraging roles in Clerk is a highly recommended approach for a cleaner, more scalable design, especially when considering future paid tiers and potentially different limits</li>
</ol>

<h3>how to not shown restricted tabs - e.g. admin</h3>
done with static layout.tsx becaus new login will cause redirect to page and re-render layout

```tsx
{user && isAdmin(user) && <Link href={PageUrl.Admin}>Admin</Link>}
```

but protected with middleware

```ts
    if (isAdminRoute(req)) {
      const user = await client.users.getUser(userId!);
      if (!isAdmin(user)) {
        return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/403", req.url));
      }
    }

<h3>create user private metadata after success signup</h3>
options :
- webhooks - after event user.created
- after signup page
- userId exist but data is null - so first time you see it create user private data

seems that after signup page is good to start because its simple and i have the cotext of new user

<h3>after signup page</h3>
<h4>Q how to navigate to it</h4>
add env variable i

CLERK_SIGN_UP_FORCE_REDIRECT_URL=/signup/success

<h4>Q how to implement it</h4

    Create a new page in your app directory (e.g., app/signup/success/page.tsx).
    Within this page, implement the client-side component (AfterSignupHandler) that uses the useClerk() hook and the useEffect to check for isSignedIn and isUserLoaded and then trigger your initializeUserPrivateMetadata Server Action.>

```ts
export default async function SignupSuccessPage() {

  await initializeSignupSuccessUserAsFreeTier()

  return <p>Signup is success , you can start your free tier</p>;
}

```

<h3>do i need clerk role or use privateData\publicData role property</h3>
roles seems way too complicated for me because in clerk role has permission but i dont need permissions just role name : admin , free-tier, .... so i think that role member in private data is enough

<h3>use withAuth HOC</h3>
by default it allow nothing so you must provide role with it

Q : how about higher order component withAuth and you pass the role it allowed and you wrap on each page. this is very nice design isnt it

A : Yes, using a Higher-Order Component (HOC) like withAuth to wrap your Next.js pages and enforce role-based access control is indeed a very nice and often preferred design pattern! It promotes code reusability, keeps your page components cleaner, and makes your authentication and authorization logic more centralized.

Why this is a nice design:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Code Reusability:</strong> You define the authentication and authorization logic once in the <code>withAuth</code> HOC and then reuse it across multiple pages. This avoids repeating the same checks in every page component.</li>
  <li><strong>Cleaner Page Components:</strong> Your actual page components can focus on their core functionality and rendering logic without being cluttered with authentication and authorization boilerplate.</li>
  <li><strong>Centralized Control:</strong> All your access control rules are managed in one place (within the <code>withAuth</code> HOC), making it easier to understand, update, and maintain your application's security policies.</li>
  <li><strong>Improved Readability:</strong> Wrapping a page with <code>withAuth(allowedRoles)</code> clearly indicates the access requirements for that page at a glance.</li>
  <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> It ensures a consistent approach to authentication and authorization across your application.</li>
</ul>

<h3>page level resource</h3>
can resource i am protecting be on page level ?

Yes, absolutely! When we talk about protecting "resources" with role-based access control (RBAC), a page in your Next.js application is a very common and fundamental type of resource that you'll want to secure.

Think of it this way:

    Resource: Anything in your application that you want to control access to. This can be data, functionality, or specific parts of the user interface.
    Page: A specific URL or view in your web application

<h3>choose roles</h3>
Q : user can be in one of these state : admin , not registred ,registred (free tier,free tier expired , payed program , payed program expired) does every state is a role

A : Yes, I've identified three primary roles based on the fundamental levels of access and responsibilities:

    Admin: Full control and management capabilities.
    Free Tier: Basic access and permissions granted to registered users without a paid subscription.
    Paid Tier: Enhanced access and permissions associated with users who have a paid subscription.

Then, for the states like "free tier expired" and "paid program expired," we'd use user metadata within Clerk to track those temporary statuses. Your application logic would then consider both the user's role and their metadata to determine their current level of access and the features available to them.

Not registerd will give null user so no need for user because here user must be registered
